# Farming Mod
## IMPORTANT!!!:
Farming mod is getting a FULL overhaul! The name will be changed from farming mod to Ficsit Farming and EVERYTHING will be changed, that means everything FarmingMod Related you have will be gone! If you want more updates on FicsitFarming please join our Discord for more information Discord

Please do not report bugs with the current version ( 'Farming Mod' ) as the overhaul means we are redoing pretty much the whole mod and it will be renamed to "Ficsit Farming". Any bugs in the current version will therefore not be fixed. Do make sure to report bugs in the Ficsit Farming mod when we release it, though!
